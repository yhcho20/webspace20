<h2>風と共に去りぬ</h2>

<strong><u>Scarlett O'Hara</u></strong> was not beautiful,
<br>but men seldom realized it when caught by her charm as the Tarleton twins were.
<br>In her face were too sharply blended the delicate features of her mother,
<br>a Coast aristocrat of French descent, and the heavy ones of her florid Irish father.

<br>But it was an arresting face, pointed of chin, square of jaw.
<br>Her eyes were pale green without a touch of hazel,
<br>starred with bristly black lashes and slightly tilted at the ends.
<br>Above them, her thick black brows slanted upward,
<br>cutting a startling oblique line in her magnolia-white skin-
<br>that skin so prized by Southern women and so carefully guarded with bonnets,
<br>veils and mittens against hot Georgia suns.
